# Module Practical: WEB303 Microservices & Serverless Applications

## Practical 1: From Foundational Setup to Inter-Service Communication

## Part 1: Set up a development environment for microservices using Go, gRPC, and Docker.

**Objective:** This part ensures your machine is ready for microservice development by installing and configuring Go, Protocol Buffers, and Docker.

### 1.1: Installing and Configuring Go

1. **Install Go**: Download and install Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

2. **Verify Installation:** Open a terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   go version
   ```

   You should see the installed version of Go.

   ```bash
   go env
    ```
    This command will display the Go environment variables, including `GOPATH` and `GOROOT`.


### 1.2: Installing Protocol Buffers & gRPC Tools
